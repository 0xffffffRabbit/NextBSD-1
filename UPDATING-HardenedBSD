[20150318] Merged first part of NOEXEC project

This is the first part of PaX's MPROTECT restriction:
* this merge brings per process level restriction settings
* eliminated the linux's sound related mmap weakness
* improved the logging
...

If you have problem with your application, then install
secadm:

 * from pkg:

	pkg install secadm

 * or from github:

	# git clone https://github.com/hardenedbsd/secadm
	# cd secadm
	# make && make install


[201502011] Changed kernel knobs

Added ``options PAX`` to enable the HardenedBSD framework.
All other PAX_* knob depends on PAX knob.


[20150131] Upgrading from systems before "HBSD: Revert the chacha20 import in full."

After the "HBSD: Revert the chacha20 import in full." commit
we lost the compatibility with the previous version, this
means ABI break, and the system is unable to properly boot.
In the background is the removed VM_INHERIT_ZERO flag, which
was previously used in libc.

The solution is to install the new world, before you booting to the new kernel.

1. make buildworld kernel
2. IMPORTANT: install world before you reboot
 2.1. mergemaster -p && make installworld && mergemaster
3. reboot
4. start in single user mode
5. cd /usr/src
6. make delete-old delete-old-libs
7. if you have buildworld or buildkernel error,
   where the cc aborting and dumping core,
   then you need to delete the content of /usr/obj directory:
 7.1 cd /usr/obj
 7.2 rm -rf *

And probably a full ports rebuild required too...
